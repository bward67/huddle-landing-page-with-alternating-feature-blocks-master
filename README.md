This was similar to the fylo dark theme landing page which I had just completed. So I made a better effort at the code for the media queries as I promised my self I would.

For the social media logos I used fontawesome as they seem to be the easest to change the colors. I found it interesting that they wanted them to all be pink in hover state rather than their corporate colors but I went with it.

The only thing that gave me trouble was the background image in mobile size - isn't it weird how it overlaps at the top and yet it doesn't on the mobile design jpeg. And the background color behind the background image gave me trouble until I realized that I must place it BEFORE the background image in my css. How silly I was trying to move it to the back by doing position: relative so that I could use z-index: -1 and of course that didn't work. Sometimes the simplest things get all cloudy when you are working on one of these challenges and the obvious gets stuck behind a big mountain :)
